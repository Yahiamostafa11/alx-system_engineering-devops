# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the outage:**  
Start: June 15, 2024, 14:00 UTC  
End: June 15, 2024, 16:30 UTC  

**Impact:**  
The main e-commerce service was down, preventing users from accessing the website and completing purchases. Approximately 85% of users were affected, experiencing timeouts and 500 error messages.

**Root Cause:**  
A misconfiguration in the load balancer caused a cascading failure, leading to an overload on the primary database server.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high error rates on the e-commerce application.
- **14:05 UTC:** Engineers began investigating the application server logs and database performance metrics.
- **14:15 UTC:** Initial assumption was a sudden spike in traffic causing the issue. Traffic management team was notified.
- **14:25 UTC:** Traffic management team identified no unusual spike in traffic. Attention shifted to load balancer configurations.
- **14:35 UTC:** Misleading debugging path: Assumed issue with application server's memory leak. Restarted application servers without resolution.
- **15:00 UTC:** Escalated to the DevOps team for deeper infrastructure analysis.
- **15:15 UTC:** DevOps identified a recent configuration change in the load balancer.
- **15:30 UTC:** Reverted load balancer configuration to previous stable state.
- **16:00 UTC:** Gradual recovery observed as the database load normalized.
- **16:30 UTC:** Full service restored, confirmed by monitoring tools and user reports.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**

The issue was caused by a recent change in the load balancer configuration. The configuration change was intended to optimize traffic distribution but inadvertently directed all traffic to a single node. This resulted in an overload of the primary database server, causing it to slow down and eventually fail to respond to queries, which led to a cascade of 500 errors across the service.

**Resolution:**

The resolution involved reverting the load balancer configuration to its previous state. Once the change was reverted, the traffic was evenly distributed across multiple nodes, allowing the primary database server to recover. Further adjustments were made to the load balancer configuration to prevent future occurrences of similar issues.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**

- Improved load balancer configuration testing protocols to ensure any changes do not lead to traffic misrouting.
- Enhanced monitoring to detect load imbalances sooner.
- Better communication channels between teams during incident response.

**Tasks:**

1. **Patch Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - Revert to previous stable configuration immediately after identifying the issue.
   - Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations in a staging environment before deploying to production.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory and Load:**
   - Enhance existing monitoring tools to provide real-time alerts on unusual load patterns.
3. **Review and Update Incident Response Procedures:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review meeting to identify gaps in the response process.
   - Update the incident response playbook to include steps for verifying load balancer configuration.
4. **Training for DevOps and Engineering Teams:**
   - Organize workshops on best practices for load balancing and traffic management.
   - Conduct regular drills simulating similar outages to improve response times.
